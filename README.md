# Steam Account Switcher
Steam Account Switcher is a tool that will let you easily switch between steam accounts. It handles closing steam, signing into the new account and reopening steam all at a click of a button. This tool is perfect for anyone that has multiple steam accounts or has multiple people that share the same computer.

*Note for this tool to work, all steam accounts will need to have been signed in at least once on the PC.*

This tool doesn't use or store any login information, instead it simply uses steams remember password feature to skip having to put in a password every time you switch steam accounts.

To get started simply:
1. Download the latest zip from the releases panel
2. Make sure you have logged into each steam account that you want to switch between at least once
3. run the SteamAccountSwitcher.exe
4. select the account you want to switch to (the currently signed in account will be highlighted in green)
